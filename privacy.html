            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
                The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving the functionality of Code X Security:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-300 pl-4">
                <li>To enable and manage features you configure (e.g., welcome messages, auto-responders, AFK system).</li>
                <li>To personalize your experience with the bot.</li>
                <li>To maintain the bot's functionality and stability.</li>
                <li>To provide support and respond to your inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-400 mb-4 border-b-2 border-red-600 pb-2">4. Data Storage and Retention</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
                We store your data only for as long as it is necessary to provide you with the services you use or until you explicitly request its removal.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-300 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>General Data Retention:</strong> Data related to features you set up (like auto-responders, AFK messages, or server configurations) is stored persistently to ensure the bot functions correctly across sessions and restarts. This data is retained until you, the user, explicitly disable or remove the corresponding feature using the bot's commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Welcome Setup:</strong> If you configure a welcome setup for your server, the associated data (e.g., welcome message, channel ID) is stored. If you reset or disable the welcome setup via the bot's commands, this specific data will be removed from our database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Auto-Responder System:</strong> When you set up auto-responder rules (e.g., trigger phrases and responses), this data is stored to allow the bot to function as intended. This data remains stored until you remove the specific auto-responder rule(s) using the bot's commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AFK System:</strong> If you set an AFK status, your AFK message and status are stored. This data is removed automatically when you return from AFK or explicitly clear your AFK status using the bot's commands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User-Initiated Deletion:</strong> You can typically remove your data associated with specific features by using the bot's commands to disable or reset those features. For comprehensive data removal requests, please contact us using the information below.
